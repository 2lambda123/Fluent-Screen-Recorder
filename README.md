### Supported platforms

The app supports Windows 10 1809+ . It is a uwp app that can run on Windows 10 for PCs and Surface Hub.

### Alternative downloads
You can also download the app manually from [Releases section](https://github.com/MarcAnt01/Fluent-Screen-Recorder/releases) assets, but this way you won't receive automatic updates. Microsoft Store is the recommended choice.
